		<h1>Unit 1 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> We used Jeroo to make a character called Jeroo move around! We used a program that makes a character for us. We learned the basics of Jeroo and the basics of coding!

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to pick flowers and toss nets.</li>
			<li>I learned how to move around.</li>
			<li>I learned the basic commands.</li>
			<li>I learned how to create a new Jeroo.</li>
			<li>I learned how to call a method.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h1>Unit 2 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 2 of Jeroo some new stuff were introduced to us. We started having to use a bit of problem solving to finish the labs. Jeroo strated to get more hard to use!
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to start the Jeroo in different places and give it flowers while also facing a certain direction.
</li>
			<li>I learned how to plant flowers in different ways trying to make it into a certain shape. 
</li>
			<li>I learned how to create more then one Jeroo and thjat you can't have more then 4.
</li>
		


		</ul>
		
		<h1>Unit 3 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 3 in Jeroo we started to get much deeper in how to make things constantly happen. We still used the same things learmed in Units 1 and 2, but it was much more struggling to figure out. 

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to start using loops.</li>
			<li>I learned how to not let one Jeroo run into another.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make the Jeroo switch Directions to move back and forth.</li>
			
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		<h1>Unit 4 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 4 in Jeroo we had harder labs and added on much more concepts. I thought Unit 4 was cool cause we were doing cause and effect type stuff. This was wgere if one thing happened something else would happen to which I thought was pretty knarly.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use x and y operaters.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do boolean variables.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do if then else statements.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do if else statements..</li>
			<li>I learned how to make a recursion in the recursive lab.</li>
			
		</ul>
