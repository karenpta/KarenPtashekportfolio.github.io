		<h1>Unit 1 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>In Unit 1 of Python we first started using python. We did a bit of math. We made a guy move around with just your arrow keys. Last we used variables. We did the very basics of using pythyon.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use math in python.</li>
			<li>I learned how to move around.</li>
			<li>I learned the basic commands.</li>
			<li>I learned how to use variables.</li>
			<li>I learned how to extract a file on the computer.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h1>Unit 2 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 2 of python we got more into depth about what we were learning. We did a lab where we had to characters each moving with a different set of arrow keys. Then their were two walls which these characters couldnt pass over or under the would just be outside. Lastly we made it so that the characters couldnt leave the premises. We also made a game ith a guy hopping and catching coins.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use if then statements.
</li>
			<li>I learned how to set bounderies for a character.
</li>
			<li>I learned how to make one thing not colllide with another.
</li>
			<li> I learned how to add a score and make the score get higher w2hen achieving certain obstacles.
</li>
		


		</ul>
		
		<h1>Unit 3 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 3 in Python we did a lot of loops. We did a game where the coin would move to random places and the guy had to go catch it in a certain amount of time. If caught points would be added to the score.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to start using loops.</li>
			<li>I learned how to use a timer.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make the game now that if the timer is done than the game is over.</li>
			<li> I learned how to make something move to random places.</li>
			
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		<h1>Unit 4 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 4 in python did lists. We made a game where aliens would cross and you had to avoid them and make it to the bottem. If you were hit it meant the game was over.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to make lists.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make characters move randomly accross the screen.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make it that if two characters collide the game is over.</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Final Project in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> For my final project in python I did a game where you had to avoid aliens while going accross the scree. If you didn't make it in time, the game was over. I also had the aliens move faster as time passed.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to change the speed of things.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make characters switch their costume with the direction that they are going in.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make a title screen that goes away after clicking a certain button.</li>
			
		</ul>
