		<h1>Unit 1 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>In Unit 1 of Python we first started using python. We did a bit of math. We made a guy move around with just your arrow keys. Last we used variables. We did the very basics of using pythyon.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use math in python.</li>
			<li>I learned how to move around.</li>
			<li>I learned the basic commands.</li>
			<li>I learned how to use variables.</li>
			<li>I learned how to extract a file on the computer.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h1>Unit 2 in Python</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 2 of python we got more into depth about what we were learning. We did a lab where we had to characters each moving with a different set of arrow keys. Then their were two walls which these characters couldnt pass over or under the would just be outside. Lastly we made it so that the characters couldnt leave the premises.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use if then statements.
</li>
			<li>I learned how to set bounderies for a character.
</li>
			<li>I learned how to make one thing not colllide with another.
</li>
		


		</ul>
		
		<h1>Unit 3 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 3 in Jeroo we started to get much deeper in how to make things constantly happen. We still used the same things learmed in Units 1 and 2, but it was much more struggling to figure out. 

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to start using loops.</li>
			<li>I learned how to not let one Jeroo run into another.</li>
			<li>I learned how to make the Jeroo switch Directions to move back and forth.</li>
			
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		<h1>Unit 4 in Jeroo</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> In Unit 4 in Jeroo we had harder labs and added on much more concepts. I thought Unit 4 was cool cause we were doing cause and effect type stuff. This was wgere if one thing happened something else would happen to which I thought was pretty knarly.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to use x and y operaters.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do boolean variables.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do if then else statements.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do if else statements..</li>
			<li>I learned how to make a recursion in the recursive lab.</li>
			
		</ul>
