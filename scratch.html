		<h2>Scratch Content</h2>
		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors.  The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked. For my name assignment I had my letters dancing around and doing fun stuff cause I like having fun!!!

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key pressed</li>
			<li>Conditional statements - used if statements to make somethiung happen if another event happened.</li>
			<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to make things nonstop, I used a repeat until block to repeat an event a certain amount of times.</li>
			<li>Sprites - I created my own sprites using the sprite editor,  I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes.</li>
			<li>Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked,  I rotated the sprites to make them move around in a cooler way.</li>
		</ul>
